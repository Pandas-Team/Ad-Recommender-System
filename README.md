# Introduction
The 2020 Data Days Competition held at Sharif university of technology.

You are given a dataset of 9 csv files and you are expected to sort adIds that are most likely to be clicked on by a certain user.
The problem and the datasets are similar to this [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/outbrain-click-prediction/data) competiton.

You can chceck the jupyter notebook and see the algorithms and preprocessing we had done.

feel free to reach out to us.

# What we did.
We tried out many different models and algorithms.\
What worked the best was random forest with 400 estimators and max_depth of 15, you can check the preproccesings and features we extracted.

## What you find in this repo
1. The final notebook.\
2. A notebook with a lot of trials which you probably won't make sense of!\
3. Another notebook with a lot of trials which you probably won't make sense of!\
So I suggest just look at the final notebook :)\

Best.
Team Pandas.
