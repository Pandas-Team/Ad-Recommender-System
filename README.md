[The link to the dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14szOHDbSmd17DXn6Iypb_NU5Ck3rktIX/view)
You are given a dataset of 9 csv files and you are expected to sort adIds that are most likely to be clicked on by a certain user.
The problem and the datasets are similar to this [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/outbrain-click-prediction/data) competiton.

You can chceck the jupyter notebook and see the algorithms and preprocessing we had done.

# What we did.
We tried out many different models and algorithms.\
What worked the best was random forest with 400 estimators and max_depth of 15, you can check the preproccesings and features we extracted.

## What you find in this repo
The final notebook which consists of all the codes.
